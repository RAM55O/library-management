**return.php**

## 🗄️ Database Schema- Return processing interface

- Automatic fine calculation

### books (Book Inventory)- Overdue detection

| Column | Type | Description |- Transaction-based processing

|--------|------|-------------|- Increases book availability

| book_id | INT (PK) | Unique book ID |

| title | VARCHAR(200) | Book title |**reports.php**

| author | VARCHAR(100) | Author name |- Multiple report views (all, issued, overdue, returned)

| isbn | VARCHAR(20) | ISBN (unique) |- Date range filtering

| category | VARCHAR(50) | Genre/category |- Statistics and insights

| quantity | INT | Total copies |- CSV export functionality

| available | INT | Copies on shelf |- Print-friendly layout



### members (Library Patrons)### Database Schema

| Column | Type | Description |

|--------|------|-------------|**books** table

| member_id | INT (PK) | Unique member ID |```sql

| full_name | VARCHAR(100) | Member name |- book_id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)

| email | VARCHAR(100) | Email (unique) |- title (Book title)

| phone | VARCHAR(15) | Contact number |- author (Author name)

| address | TEXT | Home address |- isbn (Unique identifier)

| status | ENUM | active/inactive |- category (Genre/Category)

- quantity (Total copies)

### loans (Transaction Records)- available (Available copies)

| Column | Type | Description |```

|--------|------|-------------|

| loan_id | INT (PK) | Unique loan ID |**members** table

| book_id | INT (FK) | Book reference |```sql

| member_id | INT (FK) | Member reference |- member_id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)

| issue_date | DATE | Loan date |- full_name (Member name)

| due_date | DATE | Return deadline |- email (Unique email)

| fine_amount | DECIMAL | Late fees |- address (Full address)

| status | ENUM | issued/returned |- membership_date (Registration date)

- status (active/inactive)

---```



## 💡 How the System Works**loans** table

```sql

### Data Flow Example- loan_id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)

- book_id (Foreign Key -> books)

```- member_id (Foreign Key -> members)

User Action: Issue book "1984" to "John Doe"- issue_date (Date book was issued)

- due_date (Expected return date)

Step 1: Validation- return_date (Actual return date)

├─ Check: Is John active? ✓- fine_amount (Calculated fine)

├─ Check: Is "1984" available? ✓- status (issued/returned/overdue)

└─ Check: Valid dates? ✓```



Step 2: Database Transaction## 🎯 How It Works

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

├─ INSERT INTO loans (book_id, member_id, dates...)### Workflow 1: Issue a Book

├─ UPDATE books SET available = available - 11. Go to "Issue Book" page

└─ COMMIT;2. Select an active member from dropdown

3. Select an available book

Step 3: Result4. Set issue date (default: today)

├─ Book count: 4 → 3 available5. Set due date (default: +14 days)

├─ Loan record created6. Click "Issue Book"

└─ Dashboard updated ✓7. System checks:

   - Member is active

--- 14 Days Later ---   - Book is available

   - Dates are valid

User Action: Return "1984" (5 days late)8. Transaction executes:

   - Creates loan record

Step 1: Calculate Fine   - Decreases book availability

Fine = 5 days × $1/day = $5.009. Success message displayed



Step 2: Database Transaction### Workflow 2: Return a Book

BEGIN TRANSACTION;1. Go to "Return Book" page

├─ UPDATE loans SET return_date, fine, status2. View all issued books in table

├─ UPDATE books SET available = available + 13. Overdue books highlighted in red

└─ COMMIT;4. Click "Return" button on desired loan

5. Modal shows:

Step 3: Result   - Member and book details

├─ Book count: 3 → 4 available   - Issue and due dates

├─ Fine recorded: $5.00   - Calculated fine (if overdue)

└─ Member can borrow again ✓6. Confirm return date (default: today)

```7. Transaction executes:

   - Updates loan with return date and fine

---   - Increases book availability

8. Fine amount displayed if applicable

## 🔒 Security Features

### Workflow 3: Generate Reports

| Feature | Implementation |1. Go to "Reports" page

|---------|----------------|2. View overall statistics

| SQL Injection | `mysqli_real_escape_string()` |3. Apply filters:

| XSS Attack | `htmlspecialchars()` |   - Status: All/Issued/Overdue/Returned

| Input Validation | Server-side checks |   - Date range

| Transaction Safety | `BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK` |4. View filtered results in table

| Email Validation | `filter_var(FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)` |5. Export to CSV or Print report

| CSRF Protection | Form tokens (future) |

## 🔒 Security Features

---

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**

## 📊 Business Logic   - All inputs sanitized with `clean_input()`

   - MySQLi prepared statement compatible

### Fine Calculation   - `real_escape_string()` for user data

```php

Fine Rate: $1.00 per day2. **XSS Protection**

Due Date: Oct 20, 2025   - `htmlspecialchars()` on all output

Return Date: Oct 25, 2025   - Prevents malicious script injection

Days Overdue: 5

Total Fine: 5 × $1 = $5.003. **Data Validation**

```   - Client-side: HTML5 validation attributes

   - Server-side: PHP validation functions

### Book Availability   - Email format verification

```php   - Date range validation

Total Copies (quantity): 10

Issued Books: 34. **Transaction Safety**

Available: 10 - 3 = 7   - BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK pattern

```   - Ensures data integrity

   - Prevents partial updates

### Member Status Rules

- **Active**: Can borrow books## 📊 Database Relationships

- **Inactive**: Cannot borrow (existing loans valid)

```

### Data Integritybooks (1) ----< (N) loans (N) >---- (1) members

- ❌ Cannot delete book with active loans    ↑                                    ↑

- ❌ Cannot delete member with active loans    |                                    |

- ❌ Cannot reduce quantity below issued count  book_id                            member_id

- ❌ Cannot issue book if available = 0```



---- One book can have many loans

- One member can have many loans

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

---

**Issue**: "Connection failed"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting- **Solution**: Check MySQL service is running in XAMPP Control Panel

- Verify database name in `config.php` matches phpMyAdmin

### Vercel Issues

**Issue**: "Cannot delete book with active loans"

**Problem**: "Database connection failed"- **Solution**: This is intentional. Return all loans first, then delete

```bash

Solution:**Issue**: "Book not available"

1. Check Vercel environment variables- **Solution**: Check `available` count in books table. Issue returns first.

2. Ensure DB allows remote connections

3. Test connection locally first**Issue**: White page / blank screen

```- **Solution**: Enable error reporting in `config.php`:

  ```php

**Problem**: "404 Not Found"  error_reporting(E_ALL);

```bash  ini_set('display_errors', 1);

Solution:  ```

1. Verify vercel.json exists

2. Check all PHP files are in api/ folder## 📈 Future Enhancements

3. Redeploy project

```- [ ] User authentication (admin/librarian roles)

- [ ] Email notifications for due dates

**Problem**: "Function exceeded timeout"- [ ] Barcode scanning for books

```bash- [ ] Online book reservation

Solution:- [ ] Payment gateway for fines

1. Optimize slow SQL queries- [ ] Book categories with images

2. Add indexes to database tables- [ ] Advanced search with filters

3. Upgrade Vercel plan (if needed)- [ ] Member borrowing history

```- [ ] Dashboard charts (Chart.js)

- [ ] Backup/restore functionality

### XAMPP Issues
