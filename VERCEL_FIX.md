# 🚨 VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIX - Step by Step

## ✅ UPDATED: vercel.json is now correct!

Your `vercel.json` has been updated with the correct configuration:
- Latest PHP runtime: `vercel-php@0.7.4`
- Proper routing for all pages
- Removed deprecated "builds" syntax

---

## 🔧 STEPS TO FIX YOUR DEPLOYMENT

### **STEP 1: Check Your GitHub Repo**

```powershell
# Make sure all changes are committed and pushed
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\library

# Check status
git status

# If there are changes, commit them:
git add .
git commit -m "Fix vercel.json for PHP deployment"
git push origin main
```

---

### **STEP 2: Go to Vercel Dashboard**

1. **Visit:** https://vercel.com
2. **Login** to your account
3. **Select your project** (library-management-v2 or library-management-ram)

---

### **STEP 3: Check Deployments Tab**

1. Click **"Deployments"** tab in your project
2. Look for any failed deployments (they will show in red)
3. If you see failed deployments:
   - Click on the failed deployment
   - Read the **error logs**
   - Look for specific error messages

---

### **STEP 4: Trigger a New Deployment**

#### Method A: Redeploy (Recommended)

1. In Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click the **"..."** (three dots) on latest deployment
4. Click **"Redeploy"**
5. Select **"Use existing Build Cache"** → No
6. Click **"Redeploy"**

#### Method B: Push a Change

```powershell
# Make a small change to trigger deployment
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\library

# Create a simple change
echo "# Library Management System" > README_UPDATE.txt

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy when you push to main branch.

---

### **STEP 5: Watch the Deployment**

1. In Vercel → Deployments tab
2. You'll see a new deployment starting
3. Click on it to see **real-time logs**
4. Wait for it to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

**Look for:**
- ✅ "Build Successful"
- ✅ "Deployment Ready"
- ✅ Green checkmark

**If Failed:**
- ❌ Red X mark
- Read the error message
- Common errors below

## 🐛 COMMON ERRORS & FIXES

### **Error: "No functions detected"**

**Fix:** Your `vercel.json` was wrong. It's now fixed!

### **Error: "Runtime not found"**

**Fix:** We're now using the latest `vercel-php@0.7.4`

### **Error: "Database connection failed"**

**Fix:** Add environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to: **Project → Settings → Environment Variables**
2. Add these variables:

```
Name: DB_HOST
Value: your_database_host (e.g., aws.connect.psdb.cloud)

Name: DB_USER
Value: your_database_username

Name: DB_PASS
Value: your_database_password

Name: DB_NAME
Value: library_management
```

3. Click **"Save"**
4. Go to **Deployments** → Click **"Redeploy"**

### **Error: "Function execution timed out"**

**Fix:** Your database is too slow or not responding.
- Check database connection credentials
- Use a faster database (PlanetScale recommended)

---

## 📋 VERCEL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SETUP

### **CRITICAL: You MUST add these in Vercel!**

1. **Go to:** Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → **Settings**
2. **Click:** **Environment Variables** (left sidebar)
3. **Add each variable:**

| Variable Name | Example Value | Your Value |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| `DB_HOST` | `aws.connect.psdb.cloud` | ____________ |
| `DB_USER` | `your_username` | ____________ |
| `DB_PASS` | `pscale_pw_xxxxxxxxx` | ____________ |
| `DB_NAME` | `library_management` | ____________ |

4. **Important:** Select **"Production, Preview, Development"** for each
5. Click **"Save"**
6. **Redeploy** your project
